<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Goethe</span> says in a little poem<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> that “Poems are stained glass
windows”&mdash;“<i>Gedichte sind gemalte Fensterscheiben</i>”&mdash;to be seen aright
not from the “market-place” but only from the interior of the church,
“<i>die heilige Kapelle</i>”: and that “<i>der Herr Philister</i>” (equivalent for
“indolent Reviewer”) glances at them from without and gets out of temper
because he finds them unintelligible from his “market-place” standpoint.
This comparison is a pretty conceit, and holds good as a half truth&mdash;but
not more than a half: for while the artist who paints his “church
windows” needs only to make them beautiful from within, the maker of
poems must so shape and colour his work that its outer side&mdash;the
technical, towards the “market-place” of the public&mdash;shall have no lack
of beauty, though differing from the beauty visible from the spiritual
interior.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “Sechzehn Parabeln,” <i>Gedichte</i>, Leoper’s edition (p. 180)
of Goethe’s <i>Gedichte</i>.</p></div>

<p>The old volume of <i>Edward Dowden’s Poems</i> of 1876, which is now
reprinted with additions, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii"></a>{xii}</span> been, to a limited extent, long before
the public&mdash;seen from the “market-place” by general critics, who, for
the most part, approved the outer side of the “painted windows,” and
seen perhaps from within by some few like-minded readers, who, though no
definite door was opened into “<i>die heilige Kapelle</i>,” somehow entered
in.</p>

<p>But a great many people, to whom the author’s prose works are well
known, have never even heard that he had written poetry. This is due in
a measure to the fact that the published book of poems only got into
circulation by its first small edition. Its second edition found a
silent apotheosis in flame at a great fire at the publisher’s in London,
in which nearly the whole of it perished.</p>

<p>Edward Dowden’s chief work has been as a prose writer. That fact
remains&mdash;yet it is accidental rather than essential. In the early
seventies he felt the urge very strongly towards making verse his
vocation in life, and he probably would have yielded to it, but for the
necessity to be bread-winner for a much-loved household. Poetry is a
ware of small commercial value, as most poets&mdash;at least for a long space
of their lives&mdash;have known, and prose, for even a young writer of
promise, held out prospects of bread for immediate eating. Hence to
prose he turned, and on that road went his way, and whether the
accidental<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii"></a>{xiii}</span> circumstances that determined his course at the parting of
the ways wrought loss or gain for our literature, who can say?</p>

<p>But he never wholly abandoned verse, and all through his life, even to
the very end, he would fitfully, from time to time, utter in it a part
of himself which never found complete issue in prose and which was his
most real self.</p>

<p>Perhaps the nearest approaches to his utterance in poetry occurred
sometimes in his College lecturing, when in the midst of a written
discourse he would interrupt it and stop and liberate his heart in a
little rush of words&mdash;out of the depths, accompanied by that familiar
gesture of his hands which always came to him when emotionally stirred
in speaking. Some of his students have told me that they usually found
those little extempore bits in a lecture by far the most illuminated and
inspiring parts of it, especially as it was then that his voice, always
musical in no common degree, vibrated, and acquired a richer tone.</p>

<p>In his prose writings in general he seemed to curb and restrain himself.
That he did so was by no means an evil, for the habitual retinence in
his style gave to the little rare outbreaks of emotion the quality of
charm that we find in a tender flower growing out of a solid stone wall
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Not infrequently a sort of hard irony was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv"></a>{xiv}</span> employed by him, as restraint
on enthusiasm, with occasional loosening of the curb.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Edward Dowden’s soul there seemed to be capacities which might, under
other circumstances, have made him more than a minor poet. His was a
more than usually rich, sensuous nature. This, combined with absolute
purity&mdash;the purity not of ice and snow, but of fire. And, superadded,
was an unlimited capacity for sternness&mdash;that quality which, as salt,
acts as preservative of all human ardours. He came from his Maker,
fashioned out of the stuff whereof are made saints, patriots, martyrs,
and the great lovers in the world. His work as a scholar never
obliterated anything of this in him. By this, his erudition gained
richness&mdash;the richness of vital blood. It was as no anæmic recluse that
he dwelt amongst his book-shelves, and hence no Faust-like weariness of
intellectual satiety ever came to him, no sense of being “<i>beschränkt
mit diesem Bücherhauf</i>” in his surroundings of his library (which
latterly had grown to some twenty-four thousand volumes). He lived in
company with these in a twofold way, keenly and accurately grasping all
their textual details, and at the same time valuing them for the sake,
chiefly, of spiritual converse with the writers.</p>

<p>Besides the spiritual converse he gained thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv"></a>{xv}</span> he found, as a
book-lover, a fertile source of recreation in the collecting of literary
rarities, old books, MSS. and curiosities. In this he felt the keen zest
of a sportsman. This was his shooting on the moors, his fishing in the
rivers. No living creature ever lost its life for his amusement, but in
this innocuous play he found unfailing pleasure, and many a piece of
luck he had with his gun or rod in hitting some rare bird, or landing
some big prize of a fish out of old booksellers’ catalogues or the
“carts” in the back streets.</p>

<p>His physical nature was fully and strongly developed, and it is out of
strong physical instincts that strong spiritual instincts often
grow&mdash;the boundary line between them being undefined.</p>

<p>His one athletic exercise&mdash;swimming&mdash;was to him a joy of no common sort.
He gave himself to the sea with an eagerness of body, soul and spirit,
breasting the bright waters exultingly on many a summer’s day on some
West of Ireland or Cornish shore, revelling in the sea’s life and in his
own.</p>

<p>And akin to that, in the sensuous, spiritual region of the soul, was his
feeling for all External Nature, his deep delight in the coming of each
new Spring&mdash;its blackthorn blossoms, its hazel and willow catkins, its
daffodils&mdash;and his response, as the year went on in its procession, to
the glory of the furze and heather glow and to all Earth’s sounds and
silences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi"></a>{xvi}</span></p>

<p>And of a like sort was his enjoyment of music which had the depth of a
passion.</p>

<p>Very possibly, if his lot had been cast in early Christian or mediæval
times, all these impulses towards the joy and beauty of the earth might
have been sternly crushed out by the moral forces of his character.</p>

<p>Looking at a picture of St. Jerome one day&mdash;not unlike E. D. in
feature&mdash;I said to him, “There’s what <i>you</i> would have been if you had
lived in those times.” (The saint is depicted there as lean, emaciated
and woefully dirty!).</p>

<p>It was well for Edward Dowden that he was laid hold of in his early life
by that great non-ascetic soul, William Wordsworth. He was initiated
into the inner secret of Wordsworth. He had experience of the
Wordsworthian ecstasy&mdash;that ecstasy which comes, if at all, straight as
a gift from God, and is not to be taught by the teaching of the scribes.</p>

<p>Through kinship a man who is born potentially a poet comes first into
relation with poets, and with E. Dowden’s sensuousness of capacities it
was natural that he should be in his early years attracted to Keats, to
the long, deep, rich dwelling of his verse on the vision and the sounds
of Nature. It was not until he had advanced some way towards middle life
that he came into vital contact with Shelley. He had felt aloof from
him; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii"></a>{xvii}</span> the attraction, when once owned, became very powerful, and he
yielded to the delight of the swift motion of the Shelleyan utterances.</p>

<p>He always recognized Robert Browning’s greatness profoundly, and
responded to all his best truths, especially as regards the relation, in
love, of Man and Woman, but he never became pledged to an all-round
Browning worship; his admiration had no discipleship in it.</p>

<p>For Walt Whitman, with whom a personal friendship, strong on both sides,
was formed, he felt the cordial reverence due to the giver of what he
reckoned as a gift of immense value. While condemning whatever was
unreticent in <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, he at the same time saw there the great
flood of spirituality available as a force for emancipation of our
hearts from pressure of sordidnesses in the world.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that with all his trend towards the great
spiritual and mystical forces in literature he was all along never
without a keen appreciation of the writers who brought mundane
shrewdness and wisdom. The first book he bought for himself in childhood
with the hoarded savings of his pocket-money was <i>Bacon’s Essays</i>, with
which as a small boy he became very familiar. And all through his life
he sought with unfailing pleasure the companionship of Jane Austen again
and again. And amongst the books which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii"></a>{xviii}</span> himself made, it was perhaps
his <i>Montaigne</i> that gave him, in the process of making, the delicatest
satisfaction&mdash;the satisfaction of witnessing and analysing the dexterous
play of human intellect and character on low levels.</p>

<p>His attraction to Goethe&mdash;very dominant with him in middle life&mdash;came, I
imagine, from the fact that he saw in that mightiest of the Teutons two
diverse qualities in operation&mdash;the measureless intellectual
spirituality and the vast common-sense of mundane wisdom.</p>

<p>In this attraction there was also the element of the magnetism which
draws together opposites&mdash;not less forcible than the attraction between
affinities.</p>

<p>As regards the moral nature, his own was as far as the North Pole is
from the South from that of the great sage of Weimar, whose
serenely-wise beneficence contained no potentialities of sainthood,
martyrdom or absolute human love. He sought gain from Goethe just
<i>because</i> of that unlikeness to what was in himself.</p>

<p>At one period of his literary work he was intending to make as his
“<i>opus magnus</i>” a full study of Goethe’s life and works, and with that
intent he carried on a course of reading, and laid in a great equipment
of workman’s tools&mdash;Goethe books in German, French and English. From
this project he was turned aside by a call to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix"></a>{xix}</span> the life of
Shelley&mdash;a long and difficult task. But he never lost sight of Goethe.
In one of the later years of his life, as recreation in a summer’s
holiday in Cornwall, he translated the whole of the “West-Eastern Divan”
into English verse, and previously, from time to time, isolated essays
on Goethe themes appeared amongst his prose writings. And yet it is not
unlikely that even if the task of Shelley’s biography had not
intervened, no complete study, such as he had at first planned, might
have been ever accomplished by him on Goethe, for with experience there
came to him a growing conviction that his best work in criticism could
only be done in dealing with what was written in his mother-tongue.</p>

<p>Some of Edward Dowden’s friends, Nationalist and Unionist both, have
felt regret that he, the gentle scholar, gave such large share of his
energies to the strife of politics, as if force were subtracted thereby
from his work in Literature. They are mistaken. The output of energy
thus given came back to the giver, reinforcing his prose writing with a
mundane vigour and virility, exceeding what it might have had if he had
kept himself aloof from the affairs of the nation.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, between his politics and his poetry there was a
water-tight wall of separation. Other men, to take scattered instances,
Kipling, Wordsworth, Milton, fused in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx"></a>{xx}</span> ways their political
feeling and their poetical. This Edward Dowden never attempted. I cannot
analyse the “why.”</p>

<p>Confining myself to some points which seem left out of sight in most of
the admirably appreciative obituary notices in last April’s newspapers,
I have tried to say here, in a fragmentary way, a few things about a man
of whom many things&mdash;infinitely many&mdash;might be said without exhausting
the total. He was himself at the same time many and one. He had
multiform aspects&mdash;interests very diverse&mdash;and yet life was for him in
no wise “patchy and scrappy,” but had unity throughout.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare, whose faithful scholar he was, there are diversities:
and yet, do we not image Shakespeare to our minds as one and a whole?</p>

<p>In the volumes now issued by Messrs. J. M. Dent &amp; Sons is contained all
the verse that the author left available for publication, with the
exception of a sequence of a hundred and one lyrics (which by desire is
separately published under the somewhat transparent disguise of
editorship). That little sequence, named <i>A Woman’s Reliquary</i>, is his
latest work in verse. Much in it re-echoes sounds that can be heard in
his old poems of the early seventies.</p>

<span class="i0">Traitor, and see I crown your cup with flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With violets and white sorrel from dim haunts,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fair libation&mdash;ask you to what God?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Artemis, to Artemis my Queen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not by my will did you escape the spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though piteous I might be for your glad life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Husband, and for your foolish love: the Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who heard your vows had care of you: I stooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half toward the beauty of the shining thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through some blind motion of an instant joy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when our babe reached arms to pluck the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great, round fruit between dark apple-boughs,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half, marking your wile, to fling away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Needless advantage, conquer carelessly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pass the goal with one light finger-touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just while you leaned forth the bent body’s length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach it. Could I guess I strove with three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Aphrodite, Eros, and the third&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Milanion? There upon the maple-post<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your right hand rested: the event had sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complete from darkness, and possessed the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet conceived: upon the edge of doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood with foot arrested and blind heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aware of nought save some unmastered fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reddening neck and brow. I heard you cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Judgment, both umpires!’ saw you stand erect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting, and with a face so glad, so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>{38}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shone through all my dull bewilderment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beautiful uncomprehended joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One perfect thing and bright in a strange world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I looked to see my father shamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-choke with rage and words of proper scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He nodded, and the beard upon his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulled twice or thrice, well-pleased, and laughed aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the wrinkles gathered round his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried ‘Girl, well done! My brother’s son retain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrewd head upon your shoulders! Maidens ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A veil for Atalanta, and a zone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Male fingers may unclasp! Lead home the bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare the nuptial chamber!’ At his word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life turned round: too great the shame had grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all men leagued to mock me. Could I stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confront the vulgar gladness of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At high emprise defeated, a free life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tethered, light dimmed, a virtue singular<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued to ways of common use and wont?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must I become the men’s familiar jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The comment of the matron-guild? I turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought the woods, sought silence, solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green depths divine, where the soft-footed ounce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurks, and the light deer comes and drinks and goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar paths in which the mind might gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Footing, and haply from a vantage-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>{39}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Walked past the idle groups at gossipry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought you, and laid my hand upon your wrist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew you apart, and with no shaken voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke, while the swift, hard strokes my heart out-beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed growing audible, ‘Milanion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am your wife for freedom and fair deeds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose: am I such an one a man could love?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or a clear cry at daybreak?’ And I ceased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How deemed you that first moment? That the Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had changed my heart? That I since morn had grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunter of Aphrodite’s golden shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kneeled before the victress, vowed my vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besought her pardon, ‘Aphrodite, grace!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There is a sacred place, a solitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>{40}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their solitude, a heart of strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their strength. The rocks are heaped around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A goblet of great waters ever fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one swift stream which flings itself in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the madness, mirth and melody<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twenty rivulets gathered in the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where might escapes in gladness. Here the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike deeper roots into the heart of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hold more high communion with the heavens;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in the hush of noon the silence broods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More full of vague divinity; the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow-changing and the shadows as they shift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem characters of some inscrutable law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one who lingers long will almost hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret of the world may be surprised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere he depart. It is a haunt beloved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Artemis, the echoing rocks have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her laughter and her lore, and the brown stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed, smitten by the splendour of her limbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither I came; here turned, and dared confront<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursuing thoughts; here held my life at gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ruined at least to clear loose wrack away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Study its lines of bare dismantlement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shape a strict despair. With fixed hard lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry-eyed, I set my face against the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deal with fate; the play of woven light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming and glancing on the rippled flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew to a tyranny; and one visioned face<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>{41}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would glide into the circle of my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would glide and pass away, so glad, so great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The imminent joy it brought seemed charged with fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rose, and paced from trunk to trunk, brief track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that; at least my will maintained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her law upon my limbs; they needs must turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the appointed limit. A keen cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose from my heart&mdash;‘Toils of the world grow strong,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The monster was abroad beneath the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This therefore was the moment&mdash;could my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustain her trial? And the soul replied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swift, sure ‘Yes’: yet must I look forth once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confront my anguish, nor drop blindly down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From horror into horror: and I looked&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou deliverance, thou bright victory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw thee, and was saved! The middle air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was cleft by thy impatience of revenge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy zeal to render freedom to things bound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conquest sitting on thy brow, the joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy unerring flight became to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nowise mere hope, but full enfranchisement.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sculptor of the isles has carved the deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a temple’s frieze; the maiden chained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifts one free arm across her eyes to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terror of the moment, and her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sideways averted writhes the slender neck:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While with a careless grace in flying curve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>{50}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad like Hermes in his aery poise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the gaping throat a youth extends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword held lightly. When to sacrifice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pass at morn with my tall Sthenelos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I smile, but do not speak. No! when my gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First met him I was saved; because the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hold so brave a creature I was free:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here one had come with not my father’s eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which darkened to the clamour of the crowd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And staring as I passed her to the boat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not the beauty of his strength and youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warrant for many good things in the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which could not be so poor while nourishing him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What faithlessness of heart could countervail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The witness of that brow? What dastard chains?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Andromeda, who never glanced at her<br /></span>

<span class="i0">White ashes on our hair, nor strive to drown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In faint hymn to the year’s fulfilled renown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sterile grief which is the season’s due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly above the vine-rows of rich hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the brown peasant girls move amid grapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swallow glances; let him cry for glee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yon pale mist diffused ’twixt paler shapes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once sovereign trees,&mdash;my spirit also fills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an east-wind comes moaning from the sea.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, without stop or stay the ship still momently presses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On through the foaming deep, further and further from shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-traced the furrow is cut by the keel, and in it the dolphins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bounding follow as though prey were before them in flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All betokens a fortunate voyage; light-hearted the shipman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gently handles the sail that takes on it labour for all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forward as pennon and streamer presses the voyager’s spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One alone by the mast stands reverted and sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains already blue he sees departing, he sees them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sink in the sea, while sinks every joy from his gaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also for thee has vanished the ship that bears thy Alexis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robs thee, O Dora, of friend, robs thee of, ah! the betrothed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, too, gazest in vain after me. Our hearts are still beating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one another, but ah! on one another no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235"></a>{235}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Single moment wherein I have lived, thou weigh’st in the balance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than all days erewhile coldly squandered by me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, in that moment alone, the last, arose in my bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life unhoped for in thee, come down as a gift from the Gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in vain dost thou with thy light make glorious the æther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy all-illumining day&mdash;Phœbus, by me is abhorred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back on myself I return, and fain would I there in the silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live o’er again the time when daily to me she appeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it possible beauty to see and never to feel it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not the heavenly charm work on thy dullness of soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blame not thyself, poor heart, so the poet proposes a riddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Artfully wrought into words oft to the ear of the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The network of images, lovely and strange, is a joy to the hearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still there lacketh the word affirming the sense of the whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it at last disclosed, then every spirit is gladdened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236"></a>{236}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the verse perceives meaning of twofold delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, why so late, O love, dost thou unbind from my forehead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrappings that darkened my eyes&mdash;why too late dost unbind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time the freighted bark delayed for favouring breezes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair at last rose the wind pressing off-shore to the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idle seasons of youth and idle dreams of the future<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have departed&mdash;for me only remaineth the hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, it remains the gladness remaining for me; Dora, I hold thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope to my gaze presents, Dora, thy image alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often on thy way to the temple I saw thee gay-decked and decorous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stepped the good mother beside, all ceremonious and grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick-footed wert thou and eager, bearing thy fruit to the market,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quitting the well, thy head how daringly balanced the jar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, lo! thy throat was shown, thy neck more fair than all others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fairer than others were shown the poise and play of thy limbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237"></a>{237}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ofttime I held me in fear for the totter and crash of the pitcher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet upright ever it stood, there where the kerchief was pleached.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fairest neighbour, yes, my wont it was to behold thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we behold the stars, as we contemplate the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In them rejoicing, while never once in the tranquil bosom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in shadow of thought stirs the desire to possess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus did ye pass, my years. But twenty paces asunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our dwellings, thine and mine, nor once on thy threshold I trod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the hideous deep divides us! Ye lie to the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Billows! your lordly blue to me is the colour of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already was everything in motion. A boy came running<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift to my father’s house, calling me down to the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The sail is already hoisted; it flaps in the wind,” so spake he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Weighed with a lusty cheer the anchor parts from the sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Alexis! O come!” And gravely, in token of blessing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238"></a>{238}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid my good father his hand on the clustering curls of the son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careful the mother reached me a bundle newly made ready;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Come back happy!” they cried. “Come back happy and rich.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So out of doors, the bundle under my arm, did I fling me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the wall below, there by the garden gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw thee stand; thou smiledst upon me and spake’st. “Alexis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yonder clamouring folk, are these thy comrades aboard?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distant shores thou visitest now and merchandise precious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost deal in, and jewels for the wealthy city dames.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou not bring me also one little light chain? I would buy it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thankfully. I have wished so oft to adorn me with this.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding my own I stood and asked, in the way of a merchant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First of the form, the weight exact, of the order thou gavest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Modest in truth was the price thou assignedst. While gazing upon thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neck and shoulders I saw worthy the jewels of our queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239"></a>{239}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder sounded the cry from the ship. Then saidest thou kindly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Some of the garden fruit take thou with thee on thy way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the ripest oranges&mdash;take white figs. The sea yields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never a fruit at all. Nor doth every country give fruits.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereon I stepped within; the fruit thou busily broughtest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the gathered robe bearing a burden all gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often I pleaded, “see this is enough,” and ever another<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fairer fruit down dropped, lightly touched, to thy hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at the last to the bower thou camest. There was a basket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the myrtle in bloom bent over thee, over me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilfully didst thou begin to arrange the fruit and in silence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First the orange, that lies heavy a globe of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the tenderer fig, which slightest pressure will injure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with myrtle o’erlaid, fair adorned was the gift.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I lifted it not. I stood, we looked one another<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the eyes. When straight the sight of my eyes waxed dim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a>{240}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bosom I felt on my own! and now my arm encircled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stately neck, whereon thousandfold kisses I showered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank thy head on my shoulder&mdash;by tender arms enfolded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a chain was he the man whom thou hast made blest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hands of Love I felt, he drew us with might together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice from a cloudless sky it thundered; and now there flowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears from my eyes, down streaming, weeping wert thou. I wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through sorrow and joy the world seemed to pass from our sense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever more urgent their shoreward cry; but thither to bear me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My feet refused: I cried, “Dora, and art thou not mine?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“For ever,” thou gently saidst. And thereon it seemed that our tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by some breath divine, gently were blown from our eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer the cry “Alexis!” Then peered the boy, as he sought me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In through the garden gate. How the basket he eyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a>{241}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he constrained me. How I pressed thee once more by the hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How arrived I aboard? I know as one drunken I seemed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so my companions took me to be; they bore with one ailing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And already in haze of distance the city grew dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“For ever,” Dora, thy whisper was. In my ear it echoes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even with the thunder of Zeus. There stood she by his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, his daughter, the Goddess of Love, and beside her the Graces.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So by the Gods confirmed this our union abides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O then haste thee, our bark, with the favouring winds behind thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labour, thou lusty keel, sunder the foaming flood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me to that strange haven; that so for me may the goldsmith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his workshop anon fashion the heavenly pledge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, in truth, the chainlet shall grow to a chain, O Dora.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine times loosely wound shall it encircle thy neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further, jewels most manifold will I procure for thee; golden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bracelets also. My gifts richly shall deck thy hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall the ruby contend with the emerald; loveliest sapphire<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242"></a>{242}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matched against jacinth shall stand, while with a setting of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every gem may be held in a perfect union of beauty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O what joy for the lover to grace with jewel and gold the beloved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If pearls I view, my thought is of thee; there rises before me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every ring the shape slender and fair of thy hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will barter and buy, and out of them all the fairest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt choose. I devote all my lading to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not jewel and gem alone shall thy lover procure thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a housewife would choose, that will he bring with him too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coverlets delicate, woollen and purple, hemmed to make ready<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A couch that grateful and soft fondly shall welcome the pair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lengths of the finest linen. Thou sittest and sewest and clothest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me therein and thyself, and haply also a third.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visions of hope delude my heart. Allay, O Divine Ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flames of resistless desire wildly at work in my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I fain would recall delights that are bitter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>{243}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When care to me draws near, hideous, cold and unmoved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the Erinnyes torch nor the baying of hounds infernal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strikes such terror in him, the culprit in realms of despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that phantom unmoved in me who shows me the fair one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far away. Open stands even now the garden gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another, not I, draws near&mdash;for him fruits are falling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for him, too, the fig strengthening honey retains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him too doth she draw to the bower. Does he follow? O sightless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make me, O Gods! destroy the vision of memory in me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes&mdash;a maiden is she&mdash;she who gives herself straight to one lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She to another who woes as speedily turns her around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh not, O Zeus, this time, at an oath audaciously broken&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thunder more fiercely! strike! yet hold back thy lightning shaft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send on my trace the sagging clouds. In gloom as of night-time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let thy bright lightning-flash strike this ill-fated mast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244"></a>{244}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scatter the planks around and give to the raging waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This my merchandise. Give me to the dolphins a prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now ye Muses enough! In vain is your effort to image<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in a heart that loves alternate sorrow and joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor are ye able to heal those wounds which Love has inflicted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet their assuagement comes, Gracious Ones, only from you.<br /></span>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
